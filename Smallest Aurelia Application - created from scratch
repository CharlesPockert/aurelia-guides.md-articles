This article is credited to **[Scott Allen](http://odetocode.com/about/scott-allen)** and **[Jeremy Danyow](http://www.danyow.net/)** - they both taught me how to use [jspm package manager](http://jspm.io/) to create the &quot;Hello World - size&quot; Aurelia application. I want to include it in Aurelia-Guides repository so we can use it as a basic building block in the larger samples.

**Caveat**: This approach to to create Aurelia Application is not &quot;scholarly&quot; as it skips creation and use of many important parts of application&#39;s rigging - see **[starter kit for building a standard navigation-style app with Aurelia](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation)** for all these details.

* * *

Assuming that all components of Aurelia Development Environment (see **[this](http://blog.aurelia-guides.com/2015/08/22/aurelia-develoâ€¦ment-and-tools/)** for more details) are in place, create the folder for this project:

    mkdir minimal
    cd minimal

Now, let&#39;s start with **jspm** and to create the initial skeleton

    jspm init

This command results with following (note the warning - it&#39;s a smart thing to heed at least until **jspm** becomes production version so we do not need to worry about using the beta jspm.

    warn Running jspm globally, it is advisable to locally install jspm via npm install jspm --save

This single command (note that we accepted all of the defaults offered) results with the minimal project structure shown below:

<p align=center>

</p>

The highlighted sections of this image denote all EM6 related components that `jspm init` command created

Now, let us add Aurelia - meaning at least `aurelia-framework` and `aurelia-bootstrapper` packages need to be added to our application

    jspm install aurelia-framework
    jspm install aurelia-bootstrapper

Having the complete minimal infrastructure for Aurelia in place let's build our "Hello World" application itself.

Create the ``index.html`` file that will invoke the SystemJS module loader:

    <!doctype html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Aurelia</title>
      </head>
      <body aurelia-app>
        <h1>Loading...</h1>

        <script src="jspm_packages/system.js"></script>
        <script src="config.js"></script>
        <script>
          System.import('aurelia-bootstrapper');
        </script>
      </body>
    </html>

By default, Aurelia Boostrap loader (``aurelia-bootstrapper``) expects the view model / view pair of files, named ``app``

**app.js**

    export class App {
      message = 'hello world';
    }

**app.html**

    <template>
      ${message}
    </template>

This is really everything needed for the minimal Aurelia application - however in order to be compliant with "official Aurelia samples", we will also use two utilities

    npm install gulp
    npm install browser-sync --save-dev

and provide the ``gulpfile.js``

    var gulp = require('gulp');
    var browserSync = require('browser-sync');

    // this task utilizes the browsersync plugin
    // to create a dev server instance
    // at http://localhost:9000
    gulp.task('serve', function(done) {
      browserSync({
        open: false,
        port: 9000,
        server: {
          baseDir: ['.'],
          middleware: function (req, res, next) {
            res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
            next();
          }
        }
      }, done);
    });

Now, start the webserver using ``gulp``

    gulp serve

and point the browser:

    http://localhost:9000
