Testing is an integral part of any modern web application. A write-up on testing every aspect of Aurelia from A-Z would undeniably be super helpful for newcomers as well as helping expose users of Aurelia to various aspects (not limited to unit testing).

A nicely broken up post on testing from ViewModels, to Custom Elements and Attributes. The various features like Behavior Instances, Containers and using methods like registerInstance, etc.
