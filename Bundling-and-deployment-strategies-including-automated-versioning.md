**RobertTheGray** (Robert Grayling) defines the post: I've got this working now for my projects and it was not that easy to do. I think aside from using aurelia-cli (which is not entirely ready yet), developers should also be able to learn how to deploy using gulp tasks (possibly even grunt) as well as just raw jspm bundle calls. Showing them how it works under the covers give people a better feeling of less magic in the process.

Also, (as is the case with skeleton) I've got conventional change log running and automatic version incrementing of bundles and css all from gulp without touching any files and I feel like this could be of good use to many people who are not sure about the deployment process.
