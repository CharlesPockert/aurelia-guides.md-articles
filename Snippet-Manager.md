### Summary

Aurelia-Guides Snippet Manager is a tool that **assist in clipping &quot;parts&quot; of information exchange** between participants in [Aurelia chat room](https://gitter.im/Aurelia/Discuss) and storing that information at [Aurelia-Guides](http://aurelia-guides.com/) (site currently under the construction)

My primary candidate for this tool (_thank you Dan for the tip_) was [GistBox Clipper](http://www.gistboxapp.com/) which looks as created to be Aurelia-Guides Snippet Manager. Unfortunately, after a few hours of using it and checking other people&#39;s opinion I found that:

It has several nasty bugs, the worst of which was that the click on Start a new gist button

  ![](http://blog.aurelia-guides.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/startanewgist.png)</img>

has completely unpredictable outcome - mostly of the type &quot;nothing happens&quot; :-)

This is of course sufficient to drop this candidate, however I also found that this app is classified as a PUP (potentially unwanted program) - see [this](http://www.malwarekillers.com/ads-by-gistbox-clipper-removal/) as an example.

I will evaluate two alternatives (_again, thank you Dan_) and look for more, as I believe @teslan&#39;s evaluation:

> I think that the gitter channel is extremely important to the core team because it gives them live feedback on what they are doing well and what they can improve on. However, as the channel grows it starts for them to be more like picking needles from a haystack. Hence, Aurelia-Guides - the haystack reducer.

Since then I tried [ScribeFire](http://www.scribefire.com/) - and with a lot of effort, I found what was the experience of other poor souls that tried the same

> Once a great extension, it is now so far out of date that I could not connect to any of three blog systems I use for five different sites. Do not bother.

> just a rubbish app. don't install it

or

> As the others have said here, it simply doesn't seem to work. I installed it to do offline draft posts, but with my self-hosted WordPress blog it returned a 500 Error and no details. Not very helpful unfortunately! The plugin hasn't been updated in almost a year, so I suspect it's been abandoned. I sure hope they aren't gathering and selling the username/password data I just put in...hmm...time to change my password!

Stay tuned - as I do not believe that crafting a small Aurelia app that could serve this same purpose (feeding the user created slips into Github, where these clips would be further processed and stored for Aurelia-Guides user's pleasure :-)
