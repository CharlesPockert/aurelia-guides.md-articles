Aurelia-Guides

The purpose of the Aurelia-Guides project is to collect and organize all Aurelia related information **that is not included** in the [Aurelia official documentation](http://aurelia.io/docs.html).Since this is a dynamic definition, the following few paragraphs try to refine it, with the goal to collect as valuable information as possible, with the least amount of redundancy, overlaps with official documentation and maximum accessibility. This last attribute _maximum accessibility_ is the area where we expect to offer some **innovation**, introduced [here](https://github.com/aurelia-guides/aurelia-guides.github.io/wiki/Data-Collection-and-Organization-Process#code--data-snippets).
