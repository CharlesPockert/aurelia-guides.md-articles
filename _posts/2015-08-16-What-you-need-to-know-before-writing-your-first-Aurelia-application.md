This article is envisioned as a constantly maintaned **compendium**  (_a collection of concise but detailed information about a particular subject, especially in a book or other publication_) as well as a section organized in the form of **Q & A** type document.

As an example of a compendium, [here](https://github.com/wwselleck/aurelia-starter-guide) is the article that Weston Selleck (wwseleck) wrote before he was invited to Aurelia-Guides project. 

_the initial version of this document is still being written ..._
