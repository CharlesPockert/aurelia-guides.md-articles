This is the app from Scott Allen's Pluralsight course, rewritten to illustrated the benefits of Loopback server side component which include built in Postman clone and auto-generated complete server side CRUD layer.

Note: I discussed the issues related to presenting this app in this context and Scott approved this idea. If necessary however, I may change the app to act in a different domain, as the Aurelia written front end code is not of interest in this post
