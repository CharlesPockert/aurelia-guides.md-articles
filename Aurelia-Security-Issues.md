This blog is a series of posts explaining the use of [Identity Server - with STS](https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/thinktectureidentityserver) , [Stormpath](https://stormpath.com/) and [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) as "Account Management PaaS" providers -- from the viewpoint of the Aurelia Application Developer. So, the material presented here does not attempt to define Aurelia Framework security abstraction component, but rather practical examples of using these three services

Unlike popular opinion, a typical "security services platform" does not only provide Authentication and Authorization services - it provides the complete User Management API - secure user infrastructure, from self-registration to single sign-on to token authentication. Such service is often referred to as **Identity As A Service** and a typical consumer of such services are web applications (as well as smart device applications) that have high demands on security, like healthcare patient portals or care management services.
