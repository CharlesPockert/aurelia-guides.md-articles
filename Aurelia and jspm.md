####Summary

Aurelia is **forward-thinking** above all - as explained on its **[Web site](http://aurelia.io/)**

> Written with **[ES2016](http://es6-features.org/)**. Integrates with **[Web Components](http://webcomponents.org/)**. No external dependencies except **[polyfills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill)**. Leverage the technology of the future but target today's mobile, desktop and browser environments.

Being written for ES2016, Aurelia requires the use of **[jspm](http://jspm.io/)**.

>**jspm** is a package manager for the **[SystemJS universal module loader](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs)**, built on top of the dynamic **[ES6 module loader](https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader)**

This page is dedicated to **jspm - Aurelia** relationship meaning that it provides information about jspm for Aurelia Developers.


####jspm services

- Load any module format (ES6, AMD, CommonJS and globals) directly from any registry such as npm and GitHub with flat versioned dependency management. Any custom registry endpoints can be created through the Registry API.

- For development, load modules as separate files with ES6 and plugins compiled in the browser.

- For production (or development too), optimize into a bundle, layered bundles or a self-executing bundle with a single command.
