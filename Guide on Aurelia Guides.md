# Introduction

The purpose of the Aurelia-Guides project is to collect and organize all Aurelia related information **that is not included** in the [Aurelia official documentation](http://aurelia.io/docs.html).Since this is a dynamic definition, the following few paragraphs try to refine it, with the goal to collect as valuable information as possible, with the least amount of redundancy, overlaps with official documentation and maximum accessibility. This last attribute _maximum accessibility_ is the area where we expect to offer some **innovation**.

This document - **Guide on Aurelia-Guides** addresses two different  categories of subscribers, each interacting with two categories of content

###A Readers category 
- Tutorials / blogs
- Code Snippets

###B Writers category

- Tutorials / blogs
- Code Snippets


#### 1.Tutorials / Blogs

 This category includes large portions of text written in form of a blog or a tutorial.  Creating information in this format is the primary method for adding value to Aurelia-Guides repository and includes everything of interest on how to build an Aurelia application or Aurelia Plugin, using different development tools, different back-ends, various databases, interfacing third party API, etc..(_This definition is expected to be expanded as we develop this project_). The **[Authoring blogs / tutorials](#auth_blogs)** section that follows below provides the details how to do that.

#### 2.Code snippets
acquired by people answering questions in Gitter hosted **[Aurelia/Discuss][1]** chat room. The **[Adding snippets](#auth_snippets)** section that follows below provides the details how to do that


Each of these two categories has specific workflow assigned, which describes the process of contributing data from that category.
