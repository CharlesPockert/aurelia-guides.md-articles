The workflow is slightly more than trivial, since the articles for Aurelia-Guides site **are maintained** in Github repository [https://github.com/aurelia-guides/aurelia-guides.md-articles](https://github.com/aurelia-guides/aurelia-guides.md-articles) subsequently referred to as `Aurelia-Guides sources` and they **are rendered** at [http://blog.aurelia-guides.com](http://blog.aurelia-guides.com) site.

Here is the current view of the `Aurelia-Guides sources`

The beginning of your request for contribution is well known:

**Step 1**  Clone the repository

**Step 2** Add your own article (probably starting with the article summary like:

    Testing is an integral part of any modern web application. A write-up on testing every aspect of Aurelia from A-Z would undeniably be super helpful for newcomers as well as helping expose users of Aurelia to various aspects (not limited to unit testing).

    A nicely broken up post on testing from ViewModels, to Custom Elements and Attributes. The various features like Behavior Instances, Containers and using methods like registerInstance, etc.

    **Dwayne Charrington** (Vheissu) is authoring this post.

**Step 3**  Create the [PR](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) which will be processed by the site owner (@adriatic and @delebash initially)

There are a few volunteers already that will assess whether your article matches the Aurelia-Guides needs and will let you know whether to proceed with authoring process.

Once you signal that the article is finished one of the site owners will ensure that the article appears at Aurelia-Guides site.
